Althought This repo is private no one is going to saw that but okay just for my Satisfection. I created this readme I am going to
work on this site for quite some time and just to get this opportunity to run and maintain a site it feels good. I am going to make
something so that I can run these things like a dynamic site because updating every blog is kind of difficult. Just Firstly have to 
show my resume and have to setup this like a perfect site. and have to provide the live version of the sites.
